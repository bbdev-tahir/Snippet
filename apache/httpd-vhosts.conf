# Virtual Hosts
#
# Required modules: mod_log_config

# If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at 
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

#
# VirtualHost example:
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for all requests that do not
# match a ServerName or ServerAlias in any <VirtualHost> block.
#
<VirtualHost *:80>
    #ServerAdmin webmaster@dummy-host.example.com
    DocumentRoot "${DOCROOT}"
    ServerName localhost
    #ServerAlias www.dummy-host.example.com
		<Directory "${DOCROOT}">
			Require all granted
		</Directory>
    #ErrorLog "logs/dummy-host.example.com-error.log"
    #CustomLog "logs/dummy-host.example.com-access.log" common
</VirtualHost>
<VirtualHost *:80>
    #ServerAdmin webmaster@dummy-host.example.com
    DocumentRoot "${DOCROOT}/extranomical"
    ServerName extranom.com
    #ServerAlias www.dummy-host.example.com
		<Directory "${DOCROOT}/extranomical">
			Require all granted
		</Directory>
    #ErrorLog "${DOCROOT}/extranomical/php-error.log"
    #CustomLog "logs/dummy-host.example.com-access.log" common
</VirtualHost>
<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot "${DOCROOT}/iaml.com"
    ServerName iaml-local.com
		<Directory "${DOCROOT}/iaml.com">
